# Mario
Simulation of 2D Mario. Grid based Mario :)


Abstract:

The game simulation is carried out in a world with a fixed number of levels. Mario
must navigate the levels, encounter enemies and power-ups, and collect coins, before
engaging a boss to move onto the next level. The user has no input besides the initial spec file, thus it is a simulation.

Commands to compile / run:

To compile
    g++ *.cpp 
To run
    ./a.out



Bugs: Sometimes, you need to end the program because it gets stuck after running, so I just use control + c on Windows. 
This happens every maybe 50-100 executions.
